		  <div class="projecttitle">Eliminating Adverse Control Plane Interactions
		  in <br>&nbsp &nbsp Independent Network Systems</div>

		  <p>Network system operation is typically divided into control and data
		  planes--- while the data plane is responsible for processing individual
		  messages or packets, the control plane computes the configuration of
		  devices and optimizes system-wide performance. Unfortunately, the control
		  plane of each network system or protocol layer typically operates
		  independently, resulting in poor interactions between control planes
		  across systems. I categorize such systems using four general control
		  plane coordination mechanisms that can overcome these problems, based on
		  how much information can be shared between control planes. If no
		  information is shared, control planes simply "react" to data plane changes
		  as a rudimentary form of coordination.  If all information can be shared,
		  "transparency" in decision making can remove most poor interactions. In
		  many scenarios, however, only some information can be shared (e.g.,
		  between control planes running in different companies). Coordination in
		  these scenarios is more specialized; control planes with separate data
		  plane resources can use "priority ranking" (i.e., providing a list of
		  preferences for resources without needing to show how those preferences
		  were decided; e.g., BGP routing between ISPs), and control planes with
		  shared data plane resources can use "hierarchical partitioning" (i.e.,
		  making coarse-grained decisions globally, and fine-grained decisions
		    locally; e.g., internet-wide BGP + OSPF routing).</p>

      <p>While systems utilizing control plane coordination exist today, they
      have been designed in an ad hoc fashion. I propose a set of recipes that
      show when it's appropriate to use different coordination mechanisms, based
      on key properties (information sharing and shared resources) in varied
      scenarios (layering, administrative separation, and internet-scale
      systems).</p>

		  <p>I use these recipes to guide system design in a variety of contexts, as
		  a case study in control plane coordination. Transparency can boost
		  performance in layered systems, as I show with Etalon, in the context of
		  reconfigurable datacenters. Priority ranking can better optimize for cost
		  in administratively separate systems, as I show with VDX, in the context
		  of content brokering. Hierarchical partitioning can improve responsiveness
		  in internet-scale systems, as I show with VDN, in the context of live
		  video streaming. Through this case study we find that these coordination
		  mechanisms not only solve a variety of problems, but can be efficiently
		  implemented.</p>

		  <div class="projecttitle">Reconfigurable Datacenter Networks: Etalon</div>
		  <p>As datacenter networking demands have increased, CMOS manufactures have
		  struggled to build switches with simultaneously higher bandwidth and port
		  count. Thus, researchers have proposed augmenting datacenters with very high
		  bandwidth circuit technologies (e.g., 60GHz wireless, optics) to add bandwidth
		  on demand. Modifying circuits, however, has a non-trivial reconfiguration delay,
		  leading to end-to-end challenges. In this work, we identify three key
		  challenges: rapid bandwidth fluctuation, poor demand estimation, and
		  difficult-to-schedule workloads. These challenges all derive from assumptions
		  made by the application and endhost stack about the network. Using cross-layer
		  knowledge, we solve these problems directly with: dynamic in-network queue
		  resizing to mask bandwidth fluctuations, proper demand estimation using endhost stack
		  ADUs, and rewriting application logic for easier-to-schedule demand. We evaluate
		  the efficacy of these solutions by building Etalon, an open-source
		  reconfigurable datacenter emulator for use on public testbeds, finding they can
		  improve circuit utilization by 2x, flow-completion time by 8x, and
		  HDFS write times by 9x.</p>

		  <div class="projecttitle">Mitigating the Impact of Brokers on Content Delivery: VDX</div>
		  <p>Various trends are reshaping Internet video delivery: exponential growth in
		    video traffic, increasing expectations of high video quality of experience
		    (QoE), and the proliferation of varied CDN deployments (e.g., cloud
		    computing-based, content provider-owned datacenters, and ISP-owned CDNs). More
		    fundamentally, content providers are shifting delivery from a single CDN to
		    multiple CDNs, through the use of a content broker. In our work, we show brokers
		    invalidate many traditional delivery assumptions by not communicating their
		    decisions with CDNs (e.g., shifting traffic between CDNs mid-stream invalidates
		    short- and long-term CDN traffic prediction). Using data from both a CDN and a
		    broker, we provide the first analysis of these issues, and design a proper
		    marketplace-like interface (VDX) that provides better client performance and
		    fairly pays CDNs based on their per-cluster delivery costs.</p>

            Video Delivery: VDN</div>
		  
		  <p>Live video delivery is difficult to control due to failures, flash
		    crowds, and under-provisioning at Internet-scale.  Traditional
		    caching-based solutions are not helpful due to the <em>live</em>
		    aspect. Pure centralization in the wide-area is not practical due to the
		    simultaneous need of high availability, low latency, and highly
		    optimized quality.  We design a system, VDN, that combines the quality
		    benefits of centralized optimization with the high availability and low
		    latency of distributed control, which we dub <em>hybrid control</em>.
		    Using large-scale simulation and a wide-area testbed, we show that VDN
		    can offer ~2x improvement in quality over today's DNS-based systems and
		    ~100ms join times, while providing CDN operators expressive policy
		    management.</p>
